Relational Model
This is also a type of datamodel  and use to show the relationship between teh data and the data schema .
In this the data is represneted in the tabular form called as the realtional 
tables .

In  the relational model the tables are themselves the relations and no need to make the outer connections .In this the attribute are the columns. 
In this the row represent the entries or the raw user that are participating in the database . This are called as the tuples in the database .

Some of the official defenations in the relational model:
1.Degree ->This are the total number of attribtues in the realtional table .
2.Cardinaliy -> this is the total number of the tuple in  the tables of the model like -> for the degree 4 and the attribute -> name , age ,roll number, the cardinality is 1 whenr only  there is "rohan" , 19 , 2022413.

The conceptual schema of the databse is designed based on the two attributes :
1.ER model
2.Relational schema
3.Rdbms->software that is used to implemen the second point .
What are Rdbms ?
Mysql , oracale and other stuff  .

How is the triangluar /dimond realtionship that is shwon  in the relational model ?

The dimond relation here are called as the forgrin key connection, the forgein key are the one that are use to make the connection between the twop realtional tables .
Tuple-> Use to show the single data point in the relation.

Realtional Key-> these are the attribute that are use to define each of the tuple .

What are the properties for  the realtional table ?
1.The name of the table are very distainct and not same anywhere .
2.The value in the relational model are atomic and never brokenable .
This means the these are non composite attribtue and connot be divide further  .
3.Attribute must also have unique name and the values .
The tables must follow the intergity contraints acrros the tables and msut have the data constisitency wiht the appropriate tuple inputs .

What are the keys ?
1.Reduant attribute -> Those who are not needed but are still there . 
2.Super key(sk) -> Any permuation and combniantion that uniquely define or identify each of the attribute  .

3.Candidate key -> Minmum subsets that can uniquely identify each of the tuple. It cannot have any of the redundant attribute .
Useless attribtue are the one that are removed  .

4.Alternate key ->all ck expect primary key  .
5.COMPOSITE KEY -These are the p and c of the total attribtue but the leng is min of 2  inclusive2.

The most repetation or those attribute whihc could be same for several tuple would also be counted as the redundant attribute .

what is the difference in the primary and the candidate key ?
The primary key is a candidatye key that has  number of the attribute .

******Supper key can be null adn candidate key cannot be null*****.
****ALL THE P AND C ARE THE SUPER KEY OF THE ATTRIBUTE**** .


The table in which the primary key of a table is the foreign key that is called as  the child table or  the refrance table  or the parent table relation table.


Compound key - The primary key that is formed using the two forgein key . 

SURROGATE KEY ->This basically the syntheitic primary key that is use to autogenerate the key in the table . In this hte integer value is an auto geenrated one.
 
what are the integrity contraints ? 
The integraity conmstraints are ->
First are the CURD operatiosn-> create , update , reaad and delete  .
To do the CURD operations we have to maintian a proper check of the integrity contraints ... are being maintained 
-> inofmration about the integrity constraints -> 
This integrity check are very important to, leading a failure to this would lead to corrupt database .

Corrupt databse->The putting of wrong datatype into the databases lead to foramtion of the corrupt databases .

basically integrity constraitn are the definign of the variables in during the making of the key .

domain -> int , varchar , etc , etc .
entity -> this is the deifing of the null cosntraints .but in short the primary key of the eneity model or the relation model cannot be null in any case .

refrential relation :
insert constraint -> in the forgeing key table if there are no corrosponding attribute , then u cannot put any attribute in that . measn those entiries can be only added where the forgein key are the one that can be taken as  the input .

delete constraint > the attribute cannot be removed from the parent if the attribute is in the child  .
