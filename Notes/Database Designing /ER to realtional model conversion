Transfroamtion of ER model to relattional model 

The er daigram give the model , a diagrammatric represenation , wehreas the relational mode gives output in the tabular form of ther er model . 
The relaional model in short gives the conceptual schema of the ER model  .

ER diagram to relational daigram  :
There is a combiantion of severals particicaption , cardiniality and other constraints . 
rules for making of the realitonal diagram ->
1.Strong entity becomes the whole table in the er model  .
2.entity's primary key is used as the relation's primary key 
3.The foreing key is used to eatablisb the relations  in the realtional table .


Rules for the weak enttiy :
These are one dependent on  the strong entity , althouhg they will also have theier own table .
The erntry in the primrty key  , one of those are considered as the entiy' primary key for the weak entity set table. 

The attribute of  teh cinnected strong attribute can be the set or the realional of the weak one .
