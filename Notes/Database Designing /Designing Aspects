Desiging Database 
Data Models 
A collection of conceptual tools for descirbing data relartionships , data scenamtics and consistency is called as the data model .
1.Entity realionship models 
2.relational database models.

ER model :
The entity realionship model comsist of the basic object called as entities and of realionship between these objects .
The set of all the enitity is called as the entity set  .

Relational model ?: these are the collection of the data in the form of tables to represent both the data and the realtionship among them or among the data set .

Some of the other data models :
1.Object orinted model 
2.Network data model 
3.Herierichal data model

In the first one the core principles of the object orinetd design and the model is used. 

Designing of databases :
1.Requirement Analysis 
2.Conceptual Database Design ->ER deignsing
3.Schema Refinement->Normalization for the fine tuning  
4.Logical database design ->Relational modelling 
5.Physical database desing ->Storage and indexing 
6.External database design 
7.Security design 

The relational modlling if the database is always done using the ER diagram .

ER modelling ->ER daigrams -> Relational databases .
