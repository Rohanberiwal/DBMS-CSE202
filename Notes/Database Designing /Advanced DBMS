ER Modelling  : Advanced DBMS 
Extended Feature of the Entity realtionship model :
1.Speciallization 
2.Generalizartion 
3.Higher and lower level entity sets 
4.Attribute inheritance 
5.Aggregation

Specialization : The process of designating the subgroups within an entity set is called as Specialization .The function or the set is called as the speicaliztion function or the specialiation set .

Example to the sepcialization  is/are  :
A person that could ve a customer or could be a employee is  the process of specialization  .Here in the ER model of the above the attribtue of the specializated function set are very differenty adn not common wiht the other set .


Generalization  : The commanlity by whihc the entity set that were maybe different but could be grouped under the same entity set is called as the Gneralization . The set is generalized one .

The reverse of the specialization is the proces of Gneralization .In some context we can say that the subset of the Gneraliaztion  is the specialization  and the  super set of the speicalization is the process of generalization .
 
Type of Speicaliation :
1.Disjoint ->For this if there are two entity set for that are speicalizaed for a sdingle entity , then  if the two are not having any realtion or if the two does not hold any Relationship with one other then the set thatg we get is called as the disjoint specialiation .

2.Overllapping : Tne example to this is a bank empolyee who has taken loan from the same bank is a overlapping set specialization .

The set that is get after the merging of two entity is called as the highehr level entity set and the one that are merger are  called  the lower level entity set .

3.Partial generalization or specialisation : Some of the higher level entity set may not belong to some of the low level entiy set . 

4. total generaliztion : The higher level goes into all the level of the lower level .


Attribute Inheritance  : The attribue in  the generlatized set that are then passed onto the speicalized set is /are called as the attribute inheritance . The speicalised set have these set inhertied into there attriobute and they have these as one of the attribute .


Aggregation : 
Relatioship set participate in realtionship then aggreagtion is  used  in this .This proces is sort of relationship connecte to anathor realtionship . The is also the way in  whihc a very whoole new realtionship is made on the exisitng  relationship .

Redundnat relationahip  : The realtiosnahip where the new relationship proposed does not make any chnages in the exisitng er model or it is found to ber worhtles then that is called as the redunant relatiosnhip .

To avoidf the reduannt realtionship the process or the aggregation is very much used .
