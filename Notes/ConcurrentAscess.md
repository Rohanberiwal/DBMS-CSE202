## Concurrency Control in Databases

Concurrent access to data refers to the ability of multiple users or processes to access and manipulate the same data simultaneously in a database system. In a multi-user environment, multiple individuals or applications may attempt to read from or write to the database concurrently. This introduces challenges related to data consistency, integrity, and isolation. Managing concurrent access is crucial to ensure that the database remains accurate and reliable.

### Concurrency Control

Concurrency control mechanisms are employed to manage simultaneous access to data. These mechanisms prevent conflicts and ensure that transactions are executed in a way that maintains the consistency of the database.

### Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations (e.g., read, write) that are executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure that the database remains in a consistent state, and they can be rolled back if an error occurs.

### Isolation Levels

Isolation levels define the degree to which the operations of one transaction are isolated from the operations of other concurrent transactions. Common isolation levels include Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable, each offering different trade-offs between consistency and performance.

### Locking

Locking is a common mechanism used for concurrency control. It involves placing locks on data to prevent other transactions from accessing it simultaneously. There are various types of locks, such as shared locks and exclusive locks, depending on the level of access required.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control

Instead of locking data, optimistic concurrency control assumes that conflicts are rare. Transactions proceed without locks, and at the end of the transaction, the system checks for conflicts. If a conflict is detected, the system can take appropriate action, such as rolling back one of the transactions.

### Timestamping

Each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp, and the database keeps track of the timestamps of committed transactions. This helps in managing the order of transactions and resolving conflicts.
