Transction 

What iS Transction ? 
Set of instruction is called as process in the general computaion but in the point of DBMS we called the instrcution or the processes as the Transction .

Every instruction in the computation is ATOMIC .
The meaning of atomic is that either that compution executed fully or it is not executed . There is no partial execution of the prorcess .

In the DBMS the tranction or the code is executed fully unlike the the operating system where the code may be vunerbale to a  system failure at a ooint in the code .

In short the transction of the DBMS Is very close and in the asscocaiton to the Atomicity .

Several instruction that are bundled up that is called as the transction  .

The word Transction in the DBMS is also assocaited with the Consistency .

There are two main tranction in the context of DBMS  :
1.Read(X)
2.Write(X)

Either there could be a reading operation or there could be a upation possible in the whole code .

Desirable properties of the Transction  :
The smallest unit of the atomicity in the DBMS are the transctions .
For the consistnecy the trnasction of the DBMS are supposed to be consistent .

Properties of Transction :
There are 4 main proeperties of the Transcrtion and the data base to be consistent .The abberevation is called as the ACID  .
1.A->Atomicity 
2.C->Consistency  
3.I->Isolation
4.D->Durability
