Structured Query Langauge - 4 

Having Clause  
Similar to Where i.e applies some condition on  rows . Used when we want to apply any condition after grouping  .
This is very very simialr to the Having clause .  

Count number of student in each city where the marks cross 90  .

Example 

SELECT 	count(name) , city 
FROM STUDENT GROUP BY CITY HAVING max(marks) > 90 ;

Difference between having clause and where clause ? 
The main difference is that the having clause is use to create conditoomn on  the group whereas the where si used to put a conditoon on the wehre claus .

When there is a conditon on the group fonred by GROUP BY function on that only the HAVING CLAUSE IS used . 

General Sequnce and order of clasues  :
1. SELECT 
2. FROM 
3. WHERE 
4. GROUP BY 
5. HAVING 
6. ORDER BY
7. DESC / ASC 

Syntax  :
SELECT column_1 FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name  HAVING conditon ORDER BY column_name ASC  .

Having-> Group by function 
Where -> row condition .

An example for the abive combination  :
CREATE DATABASE db_name ;
USE db_name  ;
CREATE TABLE tb_name() ;
INSERT INTO tb_name  ;
SELECT city , MAX(marks) FROM tb_name WHERE grade  = "A" GROUP BY city HAVING max(Marks) >90 ORDER BY city ;
DROP DATABASE  db_name  ;

The output for the above is the marks with grade "A" and the output is the name of the city . 

Combine operation  in  Tables Where there are several inputs :
Command_1  : Update command :
This is used to update several place with anathor input  . An example to this is  :

UPDATE tb_name 
SET col_1 = var_1 , col_2 = var_2 
WHERE condition  ;


Ex-> UPDATE student SET grade = "0" WHERE grade  = "A" ;
In the above all the grade 0 is set to grade 0 where grade was A . 

Save mode in the SQL for problem updation   :
The save mode is a pre default mode that gives warning while giving the save command , hence to turn off the save mode in the sql we can use the command : 
SET SQL-SAFE -UPDATES  = 0 ;
This command turn off the save mode and the user can do the updation very very easily . 

The above command is a sql query command .
For the specific input if we are supposed to make the changes then : An example to this is   :

CREATE DATABASE db_name ; 
USE db_name ;
SQL - SAFE -UPDATES =  0 ;
CREATE TABLE tb_name ;
INSERT INTO tb_name ; 
UPDATE tb_name SET mark  = 92 WHERE name  = "emanuel" ;
SELECT marks , city  , name FROM tb_name WHERE name  =  "emanuel" ;
DROP DATABASE db_name ; 

The updated marks will be shown now . 

The UPDATE tb_name SET input_col_name WHERE condtion name ;
Question 1 .
Update the marks of everyone to marks +1 in the student table 

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXIST db_name ; 
USE db_name ; 
CREATE TABLE tb_name ; 
INSERT INTO tb_name   ;
UPDATE tb_name  SET MARKS  = MARKS +1  ;
SELECT MARKS FROM tb_name ; 
DROP DATABASE IF EXIST db_name ; 

The above query has no use for the Where command in the Update command . 

DELETE COMMAND TO MAKE THE CHANGES : 

Synatx  :
DELETE FROM tb_name 
WHERE conditon ;

example to this is  :
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXIST db_name ; 
USE db_name  ;
CREATE TABLE TB_NAME ;
INSERT INTO TB_NAME ;
DELETE FROM TB_NAME WHERE name = "emanuel" ;
SELECT name , marks , city FROM TB_NAME  ;
DROP DATABASE IF EXIST db_name ;
