Structured Query Langauge Overview 

SQL is a data base that is seen as the collection of data that could be easily ascessed .
A software that is used ot manage the DB is called as the data base managemetn system .
The user cannot use the Data base directy but uses the dbms that in turn ascess the data in the db .  

Type of the data base  :
1. Realtional data base .->Mysql , oracale , ms ascess 
2. Non relational data base  .->Mongo DB

SQL is a realtional data base .
In the relational data base the data is stored in the from of the tables and each table is used to store the data  .
In the non relational data base the data is not stored in the from of the tables. 

What is SQL ?
> SQL is a programming language that is used to interact with the realtional databases . 

It is used to perfrom the crud operations :
1.Create 
2.Read
2.Update
4.Delete


Structure of a database :Typically a SQL 
The structure of a database has table with each table having data in it . Now each table and each data has the interconnected data in them .
Example : table 1 has the student name  , table2 has the fee , table3 has the rollnumber and the course name .


What is a table in a data base ? 
The data base in a dbms has section or columns where the data is segerated with different context but same realted type. 

Vertical section  -> column 
hoziontal section -> row 

Column show the general structure (the type of the infromation) , like the column has row with the name  , roll number , fees and the marks . This is called as the SQL Schema . Typically the schema for the sql means the desgn of the data base .

Row typically has the data for the indvisual person or the indivisual context . Like the data of person who has roll number y and fees Z  .




Creating a First database :
Code entitled :


CREATE DATABASE db_name  ;
USE db_name ;
CREATE TABLE name_table(column_1  , column_2 , column_3) ;
DROP DATABASE db_name ; 


CREATE : This is used to create the data base  and the name will be shown in the schema . 

DROP COMMAND -> this is used to delete the data base and once the data based is drop the database will not be shown in the schema . 

USE COMMAND : This is the command that tells the sql that we are going to do the operation for now on the db_name data base only and other are left aside for now .

CREATE TBALE name_table : Use to create the table .

Defining schema for the sql table  :

Example :

CREATE TABLE student (
id INT PRIMARY KEY ,
name VARCHAR(50) ,
age INT NOT NULL
) ;


***IMPORTANT POINTS TO RELATE***
SQL IS NOT A CASE SENSETIVE LANGAUGE .
GREEN SIGN IN THE SIGNAL ACTION MEAN THE CODE IS RUNNING SUCESSFULLY .
TO VIEW OUR DATABASE WE HAVE TO USE THE SCHEMA TAB AND THEN REFRESH THE SCHEMA . 
ALL THE USE CREATED DATA BASE IS SHOWN THERE .

"SYS" IS A PRE-CREATED DATA BASE AND NO CHANGE HAS TO BE MADE IN THAT. 

CLICK ON THE HIGHLIGHTED PART , BY FIRST HIGHLITING THE COMMAND , THAT WILL RUN ONLY THAT COMMAND  .
